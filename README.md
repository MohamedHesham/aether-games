* [Create React Native App](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app) - tool to get started with a React Native project
* [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) - Routing and navigation
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - State container
* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) - Thunk middleware for Redux
* [React Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) - React bindings for Redux
* [React Native Elements](https://react-native-training.github.io/react-native-elements/) - Cross Platform React Native UI Toolkit

* [React Native Form Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-form-validator) - React native form validator
* [React Native Fingerprint Scanner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-fingerprint-scanner) - React Native Fingerprint Scanner is a React Native library for authenticating users with Fingerprint (TouchID).
* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - Promise based HTTP client

And of course this list may change and Update based on Project Requirements.

### SVC
* [Git and GitHub](https://github.com/)

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd aether-games
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
### Development

We will work based on Top down approach Development.

* Slicing (interface design) 
* Adding Navigation
* Adding Actions and Animation
* State Managemnt
* Authentication
* Date Fetching

### Flux architecture
We will Use Flux Architcture to manage Application state, by Creating data layer with one way data flow.
